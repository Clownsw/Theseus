//! This crate contains the `Task` structure for supporting multithreading, 
//! and the associated code for dealing with tasks.
//! 
//! To create new `Task`s, use the [`spawn`](../spawn/index.html) crate.
//! 
//! # Examples
//! How to wait for a `Task` to complete (using `join()`) and get its exit value.
//! ```
//! taskref.join(); // taskref is the task that we're waiting on
//! if let Some(exit_result) = taskref.take_exit_value() {
//!     match exit_result {
//!         ExitValue::Completed(exit_value) => {
//!             // here: the task ran to completion successfully, so it has an exit value.
//!             // We should know the return type of this task, e.g., if `isize`,
//!             // we would need to downcast it from Any to isize.
//!             let val: Option<&isize> = exit_value.downcast_ref::<isize>();
//!             warn!("task returned exit value: {:?}", val);
//!         }
//!         ExitValue::Killed(kill_reason) => {
//!             // here: the task exited prematurely, e.g., it was killed for some reason.
//!             warn!("task was killed, reason: {:?}", kill_reason);
//!         }
//!     }
//! }
//! ```

        // *** Important Notes about Behavior after a Context Switch ***
        //
        // Here, after the actual context switch operation above,
        // `self` (curr) is now `next` because the stacks have been switched, 
        // and `next` has become another random task based on a previous task switch.
        // 
        // We cannot make any assumptions about what `next` is now, since it's unknown.
        // Hence why we dropped the local `TaskRef` for `next` right before the context switch.
        //
        // If this is **NOT** the first time the newly-current task (`self`) has run,
        // then it will resume execution below as normal because this is where it left off
        // when the context switch operation occurred.
        //
        // However, if this **is** the first time that the newly-current task (`self`) 
        // has been switched to and is running, the control flow will **NOT** proceed here.
        // Instead, it will have directly jumped to its entry point, which is `task_wrapper()`.
        //
        // As such, anything we do below should also be done in `task_wrapper()`.
        // Thus, we want to ensure that post-context switch actions below are kept minimal
        // and are easy to replicate in `task_wrapper()`.
